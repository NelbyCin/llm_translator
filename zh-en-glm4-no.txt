This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers—a theory widely circulated—but also provides details such as color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils usually cannot offer.
Scientists say that the top of this animal's feathers is chestnut brown, and the bottom is light-colored or carrot orange.
This discovery also helps to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed main shaft, known as the "rachis," but they still had other feather characteristics such as barbs and barbules. Researchers infer that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of feathers indicates that they are not used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows a mature plumage and not the downy feathers of a hatchling.
The researchers believe that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than downy fluff from a hatchling.

Candidates may send representatives to observe every aspect of the election process on-site. At night, volunteers count votes under strict supervision according to a specific procedure.

The bill stipulates that violent video games sold in California must be labeled with "18," and retailers will be fined $1,000 each time they violate the law by selling to minors.
The Attorney General and King's Counsel, Kier Starmer, issued a statement this morning announcing the public prosecution of Huna and Price.
Hou Huna has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by MP Ed Davey. It is expected that MP Norman Lamb will take over the post of Business Secretary left vacant by Davey.
Huna and Price will appear in court at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. It was Cuddeback who was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider requires facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when it pointed at the fifth person's head. Schneider was in excruciating pain, lost an eye, and had a skull bone missing, which required titanium plates to reconstruct his face.
Schneider testified via video link at a USAF base in his homeland of America.
In addition to the match on Wednesday, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions of the tournament.
Her first project was obstacle skiing, and she finished the competition with a "Did Not Finish" score in the first round. Among the 116 participants, 36 people achieved the same score.
Her other event was the giant slalom, where she ranked tenth in the women's standing group with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-ranked Austrian athlete Claudia Rosch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-ranked Hungarian athlete Gergely Dani.
Four female skiers in the sitting group failed to finish, and among the 117 competitors in the giant slalom event, 45 were unable to make it onto the leaderboard.
The Central Province police recovered the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Inspector General Elyas (D K Arya) said, "We have arrested five people who raped this Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekar Sorenki, said that all the accused were masked when they appeared in court.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car hit it, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed, and emergency rescuers have saved the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterward, Adkya was charged with murder of her son and stood trial at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any evidence from witnesses might be negatively affected because her image has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's judicial system differs; courts believe that publishing photos may cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee pointed out: "It seems there is indeed a danger if journalists publish photos and other information about suspects."
The main responsible department, the Crown Prosecution Service, told reporters that no further statements would be made before filing charges.
It was revealed that the document will mention the boundary dispute, and Palestine hopes to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
It was reported that other topics discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demanded that military forces be deployed in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority agreed to retain them for only five years.
Forest rangers will closely supervise the archers participating in the supplementary pest control experiment, as the trial will be monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the National Park Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Shooting Association (NSW), the Shooting Association has recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
The Acting Director of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Heritage Protection Branch, Mick O'Flynn, stated that the four shooters selected for the first shooting action have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelli was sworn in as a member of the new nine-member provisional electoral commission (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected for Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
Last month, the President's Committee recommended that the former CEP resign as part of efforts to move the country towards new electoral measures.
The committee was a response by Martelly to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protest activities have been triggered by some elections that were not held as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalated into violent events.
It is reported that about 60 iPods have malfunctioned and overheated, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has indicated that they have noticed 27 accidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple Inc. reported another 34 accidents caused by overheating to the department, although the company claimed these incidents "were not serious."
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry responded that it is "very regrettable" that Apple has delayed releasing the report.
The Marianas Islands experienced an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no disaster losses were reported domestically.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no signs of a tsunami were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six people are confirmed dead.
Six hostages (including children and the elderly) as well as those Filipino photographers were released early.
Two photographers then replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He received obstetrician training and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began to study preterm labor during his spare time while working in the hospital.
His research shows that administering hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Supreme Queen and my first manager. Luna passed away on a Bi-Monthly Night. Such nights are as special as she herself. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (also known as "Gold Sand") commented, "Luna is just as elusive as I am... she might be even harder to figure out... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, a survey was conducted among 1,400 respondents, and the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicated.
34% of respondents uniformly stated that they hope Queen Elizabeth II becomes Australia's last monarch.
The situation of voting is polarized, with 29% of respondents believing Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle as well as three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health has been questioned.
He has been unable to alleviate his pain with medication because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper from the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people verified this discovery with different hardware and software and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth's formation, have occurred since a comet collided with Earth long ago.
Governor Cuomo, now 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and foolish behavior."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) states that the Next Generation Air Transportation System can shorten flight routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation facilities have been added, and there are no train stops at Wembley or parking lots with transfer services on the ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the match may have to be played behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a research report published in the journal Science stated that a new species of bird has formed on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that due to breeding between the locally unique Darwin's finches and the introduced cactus giant-billed finch, this new species has evolved in just two generations, despite the belief that the process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can also be curled into tiny forms.
It can be pulled into thin threads for wrapping and knotting, or beaten or ground into sheets.
It can be made very thin, stuck onto other metals, and due to its extreme thinness, it is sometimes used for decorative purposes in hand-painted illustrations within books known as "colored manuscript" books.
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice will change according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is expressed by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir two dry powders together to mix them, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a kind of shell-like substance, which feels quite interesting.
Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every household equipped with a flushing toilet, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage treatment system.
The remains of a sewage system were found in houses in the city of Santorini, Crete.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of mixed-gender public baths.
You will use a satellite when you make a phone call to someone far away.
The satellite in space reflects the call back almost immediately after receiving it.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and vision.
It requires a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an unimaginable way. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is that it makes our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have had trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized feline animals, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits and gazelles to deer.
In the end, there are many small felids (including domestic cats), which feed on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the niche concept, where each cat is responsible for a special task to prevent competition among them.
Lions are the most gregarious of all feline species, living in large groups known as prides.
A pride consists of one to three adult males related by kinship, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These animals exhibit behaviors strikingly similar to those of lions (but different from other large cat species), and these behaviors are also extremely deadly for their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (though not very strong), swimming, and leaping; their pulling strength can reach five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same type (Panthera genus). These four big cats are the only feline species that roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as that of a lion's, but more like an angry growl.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of leopard cats is almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that jaguars track and locate prey animals by scenting and detecting the traces of their prey on the ground.
Their night vision is very strong, allowing them to see clearly in the dark and they also move stealthily. The hunting method of the leopard cat is to first blend into the surrounding environment and then pounce on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (for example, by crossing mountains and rivers, or arriving on a new island where it is impossible to easily return), they usually find themselves in an environment different from what they were used to.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor rather than what was required before.
The original population has not changed at all; they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new populations begin to adapt to the new environment and become increasingly dissimilar from other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We refer to this process as "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome of evolution and a crucial link in the evolutionary process.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide exhaled by humans.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses, and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, afraid of nothing but its own kind.
Its long jaw is covered with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there's a row on its upper jaw as well. This means anything that encounters it has no way to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, and we are still uncertain about it. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and even humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even something as massive as a Tyrannosaurus rex is no match for it.
Although most of the Romans' food is what we commonly see, they indeed had some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called hazel dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women eat sitting on chairs, while the rich prefer to gather together for banquets, eating in a side-lying position.
Several centuries later, foods introduced from America or Asia could not have appeared in the diet of ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, nor cacao, and no ancient Romans had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, considering it as the dwelling place of that god.
People offer sacrifices to gods, and priests satisfy the needs of gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard and a sacred inner chamber accessible only to priests.
Some special towers are in the shape of a pyramid, known as stepped pyramids or step pyramids, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sacred place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not very important.
Most Hebrew families spend their lives outdoors.
Women are cooking in the courtyard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan lacks large forests, so wood is very expensive.
The population of Greenland is sparse. According to the Norse Sagas, Eric the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and sailed westward, discovering land, which he named Greenland.
But whether he discovered it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belong to "Scandinavia," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not the case. Although there were some words written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and is reversed.
Although no one can be sure of the author, it is said that this large vellum document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage when it was first written.
Therefore, it is very likely that this symbol was added as a label.
The Normandy landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, choosing to cooperate with the invaders rather than resist them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces invaded southern France, an offensive known as "Operation Dragon Rider."
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by people (society) living and working together.
The word "civilization" comes from Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen"), which is related to Latin "civitas" (meaning "city" or "polis") as well, in a way defining the scale of society.
The polis is the precursor of the nation. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, with cultural footprints lingering and remaining, as well as the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence, and they are not considered a proper civilization.
During the American War of Independence, the original thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation (Congress was its sole component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no executive or judicial department at the national level, Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, but state governments often do not cooperate.
It does not have the power to override state tax laws and tariffs between states.
These terms must be agreed upon by all states in order to be amended, yet the states treat the central government with such disregard that their state representatives often absent themselves.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are both among the second most successful teams in the world, having won the FIFA World Cup championship in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making it the seventh-largest island country in the world!
Due to Japan's numerous islands, it is often referred to as "the chain of islands" from a geological perspective.
The Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors named the island "Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan and began to change the original inhabitants' methods of food production, hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan. In 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after being defeated in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled over Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana Stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of Three Windows.
In order for visitors to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on its periphery have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of film movies.
Even today, it is still in production, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, which can be a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) are the same or very similar in aspect ratio.
The often-maligned three-part method is a simple guide for creating dynamics while keeping images organized.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three equal parts (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was under close supervision.
Despite the diverse languages and customs among European countries, Christianity has bound them together for over a thousand years.
From king to commoner, its omnipresent power influences everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically established for this purpose.
The centralized power system of the Church existed in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether they had adhered to this creed.
After the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a naval blockade on Germany.
They cut off vital military and civilian supplies. It has been proven that this strategy was effective, although such a blockade violates internationally accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK has laid mines in international waters, preventing any ships from entering the entire sea area and even posing a threat to neutral vessels.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, Germany expected its unrestricted submarine warfare to elicit a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the ravages of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America and accepted a job with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a collection of poems, and a recommendation letter from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China's different periods each have their own characteristics; every era or family that ruled over the world in China represents a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, during the transitions between dynasties, there were periods of instability with many small states. The most famous was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and occurred between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various warlords fought fiercely for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands upon thousands dying to vie for the highest power over the luxurious palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from despotism to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state does not belong to a single ruler but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open to all men for application, which gave the most ambitious and successful individuals an opportunity to rise rapidly.
The military is no different, as ranks are no longer based on hierarchy but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond worldly life. He used to often meditate in a cave called "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (Light).
The cave itself not only has withstood the test of time and been preserved, but also brings to life a vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intention.
The cave is located on a mountain peak to the north of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know its existence, it's not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
In addition to the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, almost no external sights or sounds are visible or audible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only structure from the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is an Egyptian masterpiece from the third century BC, one of many large pyramids that pay tribute to deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau of the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, also known as the "Giza Pyramids," includes multiple pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a few temples, and large sphinxes.
The Great Pyramid was built in memory of Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to commemorate his wife and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like a letter V, and the "down bow" symbol resembles a staple or a square missing its bottom edge.
The upward direction refers to pushing the bow from the top, and the downward direction refers to pulling the bow from the base (i.e., where the hand holds the bow).
The bowstring at the top usually produces a softer sound, while the bottom bowstring emits a stronger and more resolute sound.
Please feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical meaning and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two children (Marie-Thérèse at 11 years old and Louis Charles at 4), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris by a group of market women from Versailles.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open all the windows of the carriage completely.
In front of the terrified queen, a rioter once waved a head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles Palace.
The war expenses for the American imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, which was used to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits obtained through long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become a basic gain for American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Order of the Temple.
The era when the event occurred is usually referred to as the height of Europe's Middle Ages, specifically during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
Before the height of the Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, and after that came the Late Middle Ages. It is conventionally believed that the Late Middle Ages ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition – human destiny is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and its manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two general ideas: one is that the development of technology itself is largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and the other is that technology will have an intrinsic "influence" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, someone might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is economically unfeasible to build a national highway network for only a few cars, so a new production method has emerged in order to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The higher number of Volkswagen vehicles also leads to a higher incidence rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for repairing injuries.
Romanticism is strongly characterized by cultural determinism, which originates from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to geography have emerged, which are much better integrated with the place where society is located than any arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal era.
It has been renowned as a luxury center since around AD 400, and this reputation lasted until around AD 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than those provided by the Byzantine market.
At this very moment, the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 11th century to the 14th century.
At first, skirt clothing was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow pace of cultural exchange, Western fashion may be behind by 25 to 30 years.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, people in Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advancements at that time was the use of buttons to fasten clothes after the Crusades.
Self-sufficient agriculture refers to agricultural activities that produce food solely to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that utilizes locally preserved seeds within the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production. Today, this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, who feel overlooked by societal norms, and foster a sense of identity among them.
Considering differences in age, race, class, position, and/or gender among members, subcultures may have distinct characteristics.
The distinctive traits that set subcultures apart may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subculture groups often use unique styles of behavior symbolically to indicate their membership, including fashion clothing, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is by using cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, have not achieved socialization during their growth without the help of adults.
Such children are called "wild child," which means a wild or untamed child. Some wild children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of children is due to parents' refusal to accept that they have serious intellectual or physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that others were raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, its behavior (within the limits of physical conditions) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning takes it a step further.
Rack-based teaching is not a learning method, but a means to assist people who are just starting to use new computer programs or initiate new projects.
The scaffolded teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of scaffolded teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
The virtual support is integrated into the software to question, prompt, and explain those programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without upbringing, love, or education, but unfortunately, things are otherwise.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical services.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that are lacking in their original family.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet add an extra dimension to its uses and satisfaction methods.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
In studying the audience's response to websites, Aime and McDermott (1998) also considered "personal involvement" and "continuous relationship" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions (facial movements that last for a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks points out in his essay "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggests that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common skill among animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research indicates that there are two types of genetic variations: dominant and recessive.
Mutations can add new genetic variations, while selection will remove variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to separation and recombination, variations fluctuate back and forth between the two libraries in each generation.
In the tropical savannah, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and it is difficult for existing plant resources to meet the primate's demand for amino acids.
In addition, failing to do so will bring about serious consequences: growth suppression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources are proteins from leaves and legumes, but primates like us find it difficult to digest such proteins unless they are cooked.
Compared to animal foods (ants, termites, eggs), they are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein and contain all essential amino acids.
In summary, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a manner similar to that used by chimpanzees on tropical savannas today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to a process where one is intentionally awakened during normal sleep and then falls asleep again shortly thereafter (within 10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that allows you to wake up without being fully startled.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed and turn off the alarm.
Other choices based on biological rhythms include drinking a large amount of liquid before bedtime (especially water or tea - which is well-known for its diuretic effect), and forcing yourself to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace is inversely proportional to the level of physical and mental tension.
The less pressure there is, the more positive vitality is expressed. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle is our own tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through Mahayana Buddhism's universal love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (inspirational energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Dhyana Yoga. By personifying different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can achieve the state of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy for all countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in systems, procedures, and culture led to the divergence of the two nations.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies have become enemies, and a cold war has ensued.
This war lasted for 40 years, and proxy armies fought on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize the army.
However, these plans were almost overnight abandoned like old rags, as over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers crossed the border and established positions in Belarus and Ukraine after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading the eastern region of Poland.
So far, shipping has been the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
In traditional terms, the navy's task is to ensure that the country maintains its ability to transport personnel and goods while also disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II, where Americans attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean to transport personnel and supplies to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, with U-boats as its main force, tried to intercept this transport.
If the Allied countries had failed at that time, Germany would very likely have conquered Britain as it did with other European nations.
Goats were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
Domestic goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other pastures, and they are typically cared for by goat herders (usually children or teenagers), who resemble the more widely known sheep herders. These grazing methods are still being used today.
The United Kingdom had built roadways as early as the 16th century.
Although the马拉轨道车 was merely composed of parallel boards, at that time, for the somewhat uneven roads, these carts could make the horses pulling them run faster and carry more loads.
An early introduction of sleepers was used to secure the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the tracks would make them more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but iron plates will cause more severe wear on wooden wheel axles of horses.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron track was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "upright man"), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have a habit of upright walking.
The phenomenon of bipedal specialization was found in fossil remains of early hominins from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join environmental protection movements, and even become active in environmentalism to some extent, which can reduce future disasters.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is evident that due to human scientific and technological progress, the world has undergone significant changes, while overpopulation and luxurious lifestyles have exacerbated the problems even more.
The handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th, after which it was sent to the John Dunlap printing shop a few blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which are now widely known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8th, John Nixon first publicly read this document in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One letter was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read the letter to his army in New York on July 9. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10.
The surviving 25 copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest extant versions of this document. The handwritten manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have been living until now, which is what we call "birds."
Many people believe they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing binary-encoded information.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, either 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, which is known as a "bit" in computer terminology.
Toxicity within the body may not manifest immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so a diagnosis cannot be made promptly.
The most powerful indicator of exposure to toxic substances may be an open container on the scene, containing drugs or household hazardous chemicals.
Check the label of the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term originates from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that have become very adapted to parasitizing humans.
Amblypsilus and bedbugs are nest-dwelling insects that adapt to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has become a major neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (consisting of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve).
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or out of consideration for the benefits of their offspring.
These couples may make adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights, allowing another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. In fact, this approach can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiment is a method used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but it is not the only way. Proposing questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific fields (including psychology) were accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West distanced itself from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many physiological and behavioral rhythms observed by researchers are largely dependent on endogenous cycles generated by the biological clock and their existence.
The rhythmic pattern is not just a simple response to external periodic signals. This rhythm has been recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that continues to operate in cycles for some time even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence that shows DNA as the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages and another using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have various different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ line cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are inherited by children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts visitors interested in natural areas, who come to admire the natural scenery including wildlife and plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about the Bornean orangutan in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town for work, and the places where those they pass on the road work are exactly where they left from.
In this dynamic traffic穿梭, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars in some way.
Now, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain a stable state for the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development over the past two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses the transportation system, yet almost everyone has complaints about it.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of such magnitude as water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they fail every day? Is it because the traffic engineers are incompetent, or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of traffic flow is concerned with the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
It is regrettable that studying traffic flow is difficult because it's impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behavior often falls within a reasonable consistency range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have a certain degree of reasonable consistency that can be roughly represented in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) traffic volume, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were among the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly makes it easier for them to avoid enemies and more effectively find food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along the body.
This gives them more small spaces to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Several thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus once said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many others hold opposite opinions; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the sun (and even other stars) as well.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and also the largest river in the world. Its water volume exceeds that of the second-largest river by more than eight times.
The Amazon River is also one of the widest rivers on Earth, with some stretches reaching up to 6 miles in width.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all river outflows to the sea worldwide.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river's water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and exquisite building techniques of the Giza Pyramids have never been surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by their ancestors' monuments that had a history of over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also has the least number of inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because these elements can be found in nature in their natural forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle proposed a theory that any thing is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming what we see around us.
Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements are metals, of course, silver and gold are also metals.
Alloys also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is composed of matter, and all matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
The atom is so small that the period at the end of this sentence can contain trillions of atoms.
Therefore, as soon as it was introduced, the pencil became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and usage of pencils have been decreasing.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener anymore.
People can only guess how the keyboard's fate will be when updated products appear.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to bring together an atomic nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Then, splitting atomic nuclei and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick near the side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
The crust is thinner beneath the shadowy side and thicker beneath highlands.
Because the crust is thinner, there may be more shadowy areas on the near side, and lava is easier to rise to the surface.
The core of motivational content theory is to find factors that are identifiable or interesting.
These theories indicate that when people mature to a certain extent and enter adulthood, some needs or desires are internalized.
These theories explore why some people want to do what they do, and what factors in their environment make them choose to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, when managers start leading former colleagues, there are two types of behavior. One situation is that they strive to maintain an "intimate relationship" with team members.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and also faces challenges in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme case, this person would transform into a completely different individual, feeling that they must change everything the team does and claim the results for themselves.
In the end, leaders bear ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of their teams.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the contact point for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings at different time zones, and local management may not understand this.
The existence of a true "invisibility team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The Invisible Team refers to a management team where each member reports to it. It sets standards for all members."
Why does an organization take so long to build a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality will occur.
Therefore, in the process of working together to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings about new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angel" (2006) interprets the continuum scheme as a method that can help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical methods in cognitive research, thereby narrowing the scope of study and making it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have known for a long time that different types of brain injuries, traumas, diseases, and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and study the structure and working process of the brain, which were never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models, which helps us understand the process of how the brain operates.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it is actually an important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling capabilities, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military affairs. Some home computers and electronic game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers would be happy to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can watch museum artifacts in class, visit an aquarium, or appreciate exquisite works of art.
It is also a good way to virtually share field trips, review the journey, and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their visit to the state capital each year. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are saved online as scrapbooks.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often use poor grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so blog authors begin to strive to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "forces students to be more insightful about the surrounding world." Encouraged by this, students become smarter and more interesting in order to cater to audience interests.
Blogging is a tool that can stimulate collaboration and also encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
Appropriate use of blogs can make students more adept at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own positions within the context of others' articles and be able to present their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, a charming city with bilingualism and boasts an array of art galleries and museums showcasing Canadian history and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north lies Muskoka River and its undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All these things make Ontario a typical image of Canada in the minds of outsiders.
The vast area further north is sparsely populated, with some places being desolate wildernesses.
A stunning demographic comparison: The number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the total population of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island, and still a separate continent for wildlife.
Smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine is prevalent in the Comoros and Mayotte countries.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
The north borders on the Sahel region; the south and west are adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is suggested that all female tourists should claim to be married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors they consider harassment; and being followed, having one's arm grabbed, etc., are not uncommon situations.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not fear standing your ground (be decisive in refusing, regardless of cultural differences!).
Modern Casablanca, a city established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was once used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid people (Merenids), with the port being known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casablanca (Casa Branca), which was abandoned only after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
In the old city of Medina, shops selling Moroccan traditional goods such as tagines, ceramics, leatherware, hookahs, and various knick-knacks are everywhere, but these stores are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the easternmost part of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Mount Nyiragongo. The volcanic lava buried most of the streets in the town, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any travel outside of Goma should be investigated in advance to understand whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has subsided.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and the cheapest gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal local price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is relatively remote, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign land.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport, it is still a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat from the desert, it was listed on the World Heritage List of Endangered Sites.
This is an important stop on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of Africa."
This city stands in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arab-style rather than African-style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River serving as its southern boundary.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wild animals and plants.
It is one of South Africa's major attractions and considered a flagship destination within the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, the park charges for maintenance and admission fees every day.
Buying a Wild Card also has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some parks or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is a byword for the Hong Kong region and also the focal point in many tourists' minds.
The numerous buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resemble a shimmering bar chart, standing out particularly vividly against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour waters.
If you want to appreciate the beauty of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to Kowloon Coast on the opposite side.
Most urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated in the reclamation land along the north shore.
This is where British colonizers occupied, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, here is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest within India is known as the Sunderbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps; they also contain remnants of vast rainforests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The area of Sun Debens is 3,850 square kilometers, with about one-third being water/marshland.
Since 1966, the Sunderbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses run throughout the day from intercity bus stations (cross-river), but most of them, especially those heading to the east and Jiajiao/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Considering that the intercity buses are often full, it is recommended to book tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas can ride in comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
To travel to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), taking a shared taxi is a quick and comfortable option.
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River, connecting Oiapoque in Brazil with Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
Two bridge towers are 83 meters high, and the length of the bridge is 378 meters, with two lanes that are each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clear space under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it did not start to be open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs checkpoint is also expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group living in the present eastern Paraguay region, leading a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle and also engaging in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is the home of indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who make a living through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as "the Great Province of the Indians," a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonial period.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the city's indigenous characteristics and features.
Argentina is renowned for having world-class horse teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held at the horse racing track in Las Cañitas in December.
On other days of the year, there are also smaller tournaments and competitions held here.
To learn about polo tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the Argentine Polo Association website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite FIC West Store.
Pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often also acceptable in Stanley.
In outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currencies can be used; please contact the landlord in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so you should exchange it before leaving.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter may seem colder than it appears: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but when wind and humidity combine, they make people feel much colder than the thermometer indicates.
There is no specific "rainy season" and "dry season": The rainfall throughout the year is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are still wild creatures, and we shouldn't feed or disturb them.
The park management stated: Maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, while keeping a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, almost all large animals such as bison, elk, moose, bears, and so on are capable of attacking humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured for not maintaining an appropriate distance. These animals are large in size, full of wildness, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu, with a population under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay once witnessed a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
In addition to a British cruiser, all other ships were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle organized and initiated by the Mau Movement for independence, a peaceful assembly in that town resulted in the assassination of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches locally. The most popular beaches are distributed across three areas.
The North Beach (located in the North Port area) stretches across the Pacific from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It's almost all beach here, swimming is safe, and most places have shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, near the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, lined with a variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The local main beer is called "No. 1 Beer." It's not complex in taste, but it's very refreshing and tasty. Another local beer is named "Manta."
Many French wines can be purchased here, but New Zealand and Australian wines may withstand long-distance transportation better.
The local tap water is completely safe for drinking, but if you still have concerns, bottled water can also be easily purchased.
To Australians, the concept of "Frappuccino" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. Black coffee in small cups is called "espresso", and the cream on a cappuccino (not foam) is piled high, while tea is not mixed with milk.
Hot chocolate has reached Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but the quality is very good.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and it is rare for injuries to occur due to participation in any of the aforementioned activities.
Nevertheless, you should still follow the advice of the relevant departments, comply with all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appear on the beaches and river mouths near 1770 town from October each year to April of the following year, and they can also be occasionally found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but rather the river mouth in northern Rockhampton.
Advance booking can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that there will be a place to stay upon arrival at the destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually collaborate with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and round-trip airport transfers, some even provide flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you require other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can hold your reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should be handled first through the travel agency rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a spot near the stage.
Remember, although the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival might continue playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If you are crossing the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location because sailing on ice can bring extremely loud noise to those affected most severely.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes city sightseeing activities. Cruise passengers are exempt from visas (for details, please refer to the terms of service).
Casinos usually do everything they can to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos typically have no windows or clocks, and the exits are also hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and stay at the casino.
Some venues offer free alcohol, but being drunk can weaken one's judgment ability; all excellent gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high-latitude areas or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, icing, or freezing temperatures.
On icy road surfaces, friction is very low; you cannot drive as you would on smooth asphalt roads.
During heavy snowfall, the amount of snow that falls in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, drifting snow, water droplets or ice on the windshield may also obstruct visibility.
On the other hand, snowy and icy weather is quite common in many countries, and traffic almost never breaks down throughout the year.
Hunting safaris may be one of the most attractive tourist activities in Africa and a highlight on many visitors' itineraries.
The term "safari" is commonly used to refer to traveling by land to admire stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows people to appreciate them better.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be quite shy of people; with a binocular telescope, you can see them more clearly.
Hiking (also known as "jungle walking," "trekking," or "hike") mainly involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, with the first being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before announcing the postponement, you may face a tricky situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellations implemented due to the novel coronavirus had not been extended to July 2020—the originally scheduled time for the Olympics.
The ticket prices for most events are expected to range from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with general tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Even if there is no iron and an ironing board in the room, many hotels offer a borrowing service.
If you don't have an iron or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if available).
Be careful not to let the clothes become too hot (this may cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, it could burn the fabric).
There are many methods to purify water, some of which are more effective for specific pollutants.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other regions it takes several minutes.
The effects of filters vary, and if you have any concerns about this, then you should consider purchasing bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food, cause irritative reactions, and in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions or spread venomous substances or infectious diseases.
Diseases transmitted by infectious diseases, or those dangerous animals that can kill humans through violence, are usually not classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase tax-exempt goods at specific locations.
Travelers to countries or regions with heavy taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, and it's especially cost-effective to buy products like alcohol and tobacco there.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the most challenging driving conditions are found on the section between Point Marion and Fairmont, where it frequently passes through numerous remote rural areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: there are steep hills, narrow lanes, and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limit posted there is significantly lower than that of the previous and subsequent sections, with a common speed limit of 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and adhering strictly to the speed limits here is even more important than in other areas.
However, it is strange that the mobile service here is much stronger than on many other routes along the way (such as the Pennsylvania wilderness).
The pastries in Germany are quite good, and those in Bavaria are even more diverse and colorful, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit desserts are common, apples can be used to make desserts all year round, and cherries and plums can also be enjoyed in summer.
Many German baked goods are also characterized by almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with strong coffee.

Curry dishes are a type of cuisine that primarily features herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry dishes can be either "dry" or "wet," and the dryness level depends on the amount of water used.
In the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry; while in southern India and some other coastal regions on the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term that covers various local cuisines across the country.
But without additional adjectives, the word usually refers to food native to the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, you can enjoy Javanese cuisine all over the archipelago, which includes a variety of dishes with simple seasoning methods, and the main seasonings favored by Indonesians are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially coconut palm sugar), and various spices.
The stirrups are suspended on both sides of the saddle, used to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also safety hazards as the rider's feet may get caught.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but one foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him or her along while running. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders would wear boots with heels and smooth soles that are quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles—especially English-style saddles—are equipped with safety straps that will come off the saddle if a rider falls and pulls backward.
The Chilean top mountain climbing destination, Cochamó Valley, is known as the Yosemite of South America, featuring a variety of granite cliffs and steep walls.

Alpine skiing includes both regular skiing and snowboard skiing, which is a very popular sport. In this activity, skis or snowboards are attached to your feet, sliding down snowy terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many skiing enthusiasts, who are sometimes also called "ski fanatics," and they plan to ski at a certain location throughout their entire vacation.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time—cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to as early as 5,000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back at least to the 17th century; in 1861, Norwegians established the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Skiing independently: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski tourism, or backcountry skiing.
This activity is related to Alpine skiing tours or mountaineering, but these activities are usually not carried out. These two activities require steep terrain and harder skis and boots.
Imagine the ski routes as similar to hiking trails.
When conditions are good, you can walk further than on foot—but only in very few cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on flat tracks.
Europe is a continent with relatively small land area but many independent countries. In most cases, traveling through multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to go through passport checkpoint checks again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately from each member state of the Schengen Area, thereby saving time, money, and procedures.
There is no unified definition for what constitutes an antique item. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies geographically, with year limits in North America and other places possibly being shorter than those in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although they are much younger in years compared to their mass-produced counterparts.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The culture surrounding this industry is also significant to many who earn a living from other professions.
However, even from a traditional perspective, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry; they make a living through activities such as fishing and hunting, and usually use reindeer as draft animals.
Now many Sami people are involved in modern industries. The tourism industry is a major source of income for Sapmi, also known as the Sami region.
Although the term "Gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is generally considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel warnings, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is formulated for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different circumstances than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the suggestions offered here are often rather rough, general, and overly simplistic.

The course training usually lasts for 2 to 5 days, involving role-playing exercises, first aid training, and sometimes armed training as well.
There are many books and magazines about wilderness survival, but there are very few publications on battlefield survival.
Travelers planning to undergo gender confirmation surgery abroad must bring valid documents upon their return.
As for whether or not to issue passports without indicating gender (X), or whether they are willing to change documents to match desired names and genders, the intentions of governments vary from country to country.
Foreign governments have varying degrees of recognition for these documents.
In the era after September 11, 2001, searches at security checkpoints have also become more intrusive.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery must disclose their privacy when passing through scanners and cannot guarantee their own dignity.
Rip currents are rapid backflows of seawater from the beach to the sea, usually occurring in areas with reefs or similar features.
The underwater terrain causes backflow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where rapid currents flowing towards the deep water may form.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and exhaustion, it is not likely to succeed in swimming against the current.
After getting away from the turbulent current, it's not so difficult to swim back.
Strive to swim towards a place where you will not be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been discovered).
The impact of returning home is faster (the honeymoon period is shorter) than culture shock, lasts longer, and may also be more severe.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while and returning home, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and let go of some habits from your hometown's culture.

The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which is the settlement site of "Villa Las Estrellas."
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island. There, an active volcano crater is submerged by floodwaters, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula merge here with a highland, then re-form into the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The north, or Sentinel Range, is home to the highest mountain range in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, with its peak reaching 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phone signals are not available, satellite phones may be your only option.
Generally, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outdoors where there is a clear satellite signal.
The service is often used in shipping, including yachts and expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those who plan how to spend their gap year, studying abroad has become an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, who can take a year off before going to college without affecting their education.

In most cases, tuition fees are required to participate in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," and it also contains thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes, a yacht is not necessary.
The coastal islands and the largest several lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, yet smaller boats even canoes offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but are quite unique in other aspects (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic cruise ships will stay in St. Petersburg, Russia for a longer period of time.
This means you can spend several whole days visiting this historic city and then go back to the boat to sleep at night.
If you are disembarking for a cruise ship tour only, no separate visa is required (as per regulations up to 2009).
Some cruise ships highlight Berlin, Germany in their promotional brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and the cost of the riverboat tour is not included in the price.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, flying can be a terrifying experience, especially for those who have never flown or had painful experiences before.

Couriers can earn high remuneration for quick delivery of goods. Often, time is very important for business documents, commodities, or parts used for emergency repairs.
In some routes, large companies have their own planes, but there are problems for other routes and small companies.
If they transport goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The quickest way is to have it transported as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, luggage of passengers who haven't boarded the plane is prohibited from being carried, and in such cases, your presence is required.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
However, it's not cheap: according to rough estimates, the fare for business class may be four times that of economy class, and first-class tickets can even cost eleven times more!
Generally speaking, there's no need to look for discounted business or first-class tickets when flying directly from Location A to Location B.
The airline is well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of a self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between these two Moldovan regions have been restored.
