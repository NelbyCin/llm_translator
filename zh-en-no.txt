This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown at the top and light or carrot-colored at the bottom.
This discovery also helps to deepen our understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs did not develop a well-defined central shaft - known as the "rachis", but still had other feather features such as barbs and barbules, researchers infer that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the down of a chick.

Most of the completed work is theoretical, but the purpose of writing the program is to simulate observations of the Andromeda Galaxy.
The effect that the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between dark matter in galaxies and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational force on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory suggests that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in some kind of halo surrounding the galaxy, composed of many small particles.

Director of Public Prosecutions and Royal Legal Advisor Kier Starmer announced this morning that charges have been brought against Huna and Price.
Huwanna has resigned, and his position in the cabinet will be taken over by Member of Parliament Ed Davey. It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will take over the vacant position of Minister of Business left by Davey.
Huna and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla's arm and chin were injured, while Kristoffer Schneider needs facial reconstruction surgery.
When Uka's weapon malfunctioned while pointing at the fifth person, Schneider was in excruciating pain, with one eye blinded, a piece of skull missing, and had to reshape his face using titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link at the USAF base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's game, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions in the championship.
Her first project was obstacle skiing, and she ended the competition with an "unfinished" result in the first round. 36 out of the 116 participants achieved the same result in the competition.
Her other event is the 200m backstroke, where she finished tenth in the women's standing group with a total time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 behind the first-place Austrian swimmer Claudia Roth and 1:09.02 behind the ninth-place Hungarian swimmer Kinga Dani.
Four female skiers in the seated group did not finish the race, with 45 out of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom event failing to make it onto the leaderboard.
The Central Province police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 men for raping the Swiss woman and found her phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants all had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although the car crashed into the house with three people inside, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver's head was seriously injured.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency rescue personnel have rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first, he was sent to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adekya was charged with murdering her son and appeared in court at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; but any evidence from witnesses may be negatively influenced as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, and the court believes that publishing photos could cause potential harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out: "It seems indeed harmful if journalists disclose the photos and other information of suspects."
The main department responsible for prosecution, the Royal Prosecution Service, told reporters that they will not make any further comments until at least after filing charges.
According to reports, the document will mention border disputes, with Palestine hoping to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other topics of discussion include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to deploy military forces in the central valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to retain them for five years.
Foresters will closely monitor the shooters participating in the supplementary pest control experiments, as the experiments will be monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Shooting Association (NSW), the shooting association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O’flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Management at New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), stated that the four shooters selected to participate in the first culling operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected for the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in Haiti in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the former CEP to resign, as part of the push for the country to move towards new election measures.
The committee is Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protest activities have been triggered by some elections that have failed to take place as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalate into violent incidents.
According to reports, there have been about 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in a total of 6 fires and 4 people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has noted 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents to the department, although the company claimed that these incidents were "not serious".
The Economic Industry Department responded that the delay in releasing the report by Apple is "very regrettable".
An earthquake occurred in the Northern Mariana Islands at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM Greenwich Mean Time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that according to reports, there have been no disaster losses domestically.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no tsunami signs were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza raised his M16 rifle and fired at the tourists.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, with at least six hostages confirmed dead at present.
Six hostages (including children and elderly) as well as those Filipino photographers were released in advance.
The two photographers then replaced an old woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendosa was then shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and has been working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital since 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research shows that applying hormones can accelerate the maturation of the baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourn Luna one after another.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first supreme queen, my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the double moons. Such nights are as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels (Dustin Runnels, also known as "Goldust") commented, "Luna is as unpredictable as I am... she may be even more unpredictable... I love her, and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, a survey was conducted on 1,400 respondents, showing that the number of respondents opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicates.
34% of the respondents unanimously expressed their hope that Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom would become the last monarch of Australia.
There is a polarization in the voting, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never establish a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and the three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his health condition has been constantly questioned.
He has always been unable to use medication to relieve pain because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper at the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several people used different hardware and software to verify this discovery and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of water and organic materials on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets have formed since the collision between comets and Earth a long time ago, especially the formation of Earth.
Cuomo, 53, has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as "political gibberish and foolish behavior".
According to speculation, he will participate in the presidential election in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States states that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
Without additional transportation options, the overground train at Wembley does not stop, and there are no parking lots or transfer facilities on the ground.
Due to concerns about the lack of transportation, the game may be forced to be held behind closed doors without any team supporters.
On Thursday, a research report published in the journal "Science" stated that a new species of bird has formed in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the native Darwin's finches and the introduced cactus finches, despite the belief that this process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into fine threads for wrapping and knotting. It can also be pounded or rolled into flakes.
It can be made very thin, adhered to other metals, and because it is so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change according to the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value is a measure of the hydrogen ions (H) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together to mix them, then use clean wet hands to knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a layer of something similar to a shell, which feels very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every household, which were connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
The remains of a sewage system were found in houses in the cities of Knossos on the island of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of mixed-gender public baths.
When you call someone who is far away thousands of miles, you will use satellites.
After receiving the call in space, the satellite almost immediately reflected it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts certain light and visibility.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet high is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest contribution of the wheel to us is to make our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines, which prey on medium-sized animals, from rabbits and antelopes to deer.
In the end, there are many small felids (including free-roaming pet cats) that prey on much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, with each cat responsible for a specific task to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The lion pride is made up of one to three adult males with familial relationships, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a big family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals exhibit remarkably similar behaviors to lions (but unlike other large felines), and these behaviors are also very deadly for their prey.
The tiger is an all-around athlete, it can climb (although its climbing ability is not very strong), swim, jump far, and its pulling force can reach five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only members of the Felidae family that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as the roar of a lion, but more like an angry growl.
The clouded leopards like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of clouded leopards are almost always much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the jaguarundi tracks and hunts prey on the ground through scent and sniffing.
Their night vision is very strong, they can see clearly in the dark, and their movements are very stealthy. The hunting method of the leopard cat is to blend into the surrounding environment first, and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from their original main population (such as crossing mountains and rivers, or reaching a new island where it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptabilities to become a strong competitor, rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time passes, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, and they start to become increasingly dissimilar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually appear to be completely different, to the point where they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary outcome of evolution and a crucial part of the evolutionary process.
Plants can produce the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They can also provide shade and coolness.
We use plants to build houses, to make clothes. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Azure Dragon was the top predator of that era, fearing nothing except its own kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with a row on the upper jaw as well. This means that anything that encounters it has no way to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, which we are not sure about. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other sea dragons, and it may even eat humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although most of the Roman food is familiar to us, they do have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to gather together and have banquets, eating while reclining.
The food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, considering it as the residence of that god.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has a courtyard open to the public, as well as an inner sanctum accessible only to priests.
Some special towers are in the shape of a pyramid and are called pyramid-shaped pagodas, which are built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special holy place for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not very important.
Hebrew families mostly spend their lives outdoors.
The women are cooking in the yard; the shop is actually an open counter facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan does not have large forests, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland has a sparse population. According to the Norse epic Saga of the Icelanders, the red-bearded Eric was exiled from Iceland for murder, sailed west, discovered land, and named it Greenland.
But whether he noticed it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belonging to "Scandinavia", there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have watched the movie "National Treasure", you might think that there is a treasure map on the back of the "Declaration of Independence".
However, the reality is not so. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the "Declaration of Independence" is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been rolled up for storage when it was first written.
Therefore, it is very likely that this symbol was added just as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These French people reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not resisting the invaders, but cooperating with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an operation known as "Operation Dragoon".
Just two weeks, the armies of the United States and Free France liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a population (society) living and working together.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "of a citizen"), and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "state"), which in some way defines the scale of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means the passing down of knowledge from generation to generation, the lingering presence of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without a trace without leaving behind relevant historical evidence, and are not considered as civilized as others.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial department, Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, but state governments often do not cooperate.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These terms must be modified with the unanimous consent of all states, but the states are very disrespectful towards the central government, resulting in their state representatives often being absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island country in the world!
Due to the large number of islands in Japan, it is often referred to as the "island nation" from a geological perspective.
Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, beginning to change the indigenous people's food production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire announced the establishment of a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana stone, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
In order to allow visitors to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of film.
To this day, production still exists, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, making this format a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) have the same aspect ratio or are fairly close to it.
The frequently misused and ridiculed rule of thirds can be a simple guiding method when creating dynamics, and it can also help keep the image organized.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church came under close scrutiny.
Although the languages and customs of European countries are different, for over a thousand years, Christianity has connected them together.
From the king to the common people, the power that spreads in all directions influences everyone.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically established for this purpose.
The centralized system of power in the Roman Catholic Church existed for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they have adhered to this creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
They cut off the vital military and civilian supplies. The fact proves that this strategy is effective, although such a blockade violates the widely accepted international law established by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain is laying mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even posing a threat to neutral ships.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine warfare will also receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the brutality and devastation of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
In different periods of ancient China, each had its own characteristics; each period or ruling family in charge of the country was a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, during the changes of dynasties throughout history, it was a period of instability with small countries dividing. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and was between the transitions of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various warlords waged fierce wars to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest power in the luxurious palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
After the revolution, official positions were open for application to all males, giving ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to succeed.
The military is also based on ability rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in different countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad is very interested in things beyond worldly life. He used to often go to a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself not only withstands the test of time and remains intact, but also vividly portrays Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a mountain top in the northern part of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once you enter the cave, you are completely isolated from the world.
Except for the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, almost nothing can be seen or heard from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids built to pay tribute to the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt includes multiple pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V, and the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom edge.
Upward refers to pushing the bow from the top, while downward refers to pulling the bow from the base of the bow (where the hand holds the bow).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger and more firm sound.
Please feel free to use a pencil to make your own markings, but remember, the printed notes have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women.
They rode a carriage back to Paris, where a group of people surrounded them, shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
In front of the terrified queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government, which covered most of the expenses, as well as the interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the basic income of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Knights Templar.
The period in which the event occurred is often referred to as the heyday of European history, namely the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the heyday of the Middle Ages was the early Middle Ages, and after that was the late Middle Ages. It is conventionally believed that the late Middle Ages ended around 1500.
The technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition - human destiny is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two overall ideas: first, the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and second, technology in turn will have an inherent "impact" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, some people may argue that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to build a national highway network for only a few cars, so a new production method has emerged to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The high number of Volkswagen cars will lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for treating injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism color. This is derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the background of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge. These customs and cultures, harmoniously integrated with the society's location, are much better than any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a luxury goods center began around the year 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the 12th century mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th century.
At first, the dress was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages approached the end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advancements at that time was that after the Crusades, people began using buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agricultural activities carried out to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and usually organic system that maximizes yields by using local seeds preserved in the ecosystem and combining them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
From a historical perspective, the majority of farmers are engaged in subsistence agricultural production. This situation still exists in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, who feel overlooked by societal norms, fostering a sense of belonging among them.
Given the age, race, class, position, and/or gender differences among members, subcultures may have their own unique characteristics.
The distinctive traits that make subcultures unique may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultures often use symbolic styles of behavior to express their group identity, including fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, have not been able to achieve socialization without the help of adults during their growth process.
Children like this are called "wild children," meaning feral children. Some wild children are confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept their intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; some people live alone in the wild.
If a wolf child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits allowed by their physical condition) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning goes even further.
The scaffold teaching is not a learning method, but a means to assist people who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.
The scaffold teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffold teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without manners, care, and education, but things don't always go as planned.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide everything that the original family lacks in essentials.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet add extra dimensions to its uses and modes of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying audience reactions to websites, Ai Mai and McKee (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video has brought significant discoveries in explaining microexpressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that the ability to understand human behavior may be a common skill among animals such as dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of gene mutations: dominant and recessive.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, while selection removes variations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to segregation and recombination, variations fluctuate between the two populations in each generation.
In tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are difficult to meet the primates' needs for amino acids.
In addition, failure to do so will result in serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant-based resources should be the protein found in leaves and legumes, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest this protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In conclusion, if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees in the tropical grasslands today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully disturbing you.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythmic based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid before bed (especially water or tea - known to have a diuretic effect) and forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the level of physical and mental tension.
The smaller the pressure, the more positive vitality will be shown. Everyone has the possibility to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach the state of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky Yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can reach the state of enlightenment.
Germany was the common enemy of various countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, conflicts in terms of systems, procedures, and culture caused the two countries to go their separate ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War began immediately.
This war lasted for 40 years, with proxy armies fighting real battles on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense line had been breached, the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered, and fortifications were built in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping has been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the navy's mission is to ensure the country's ability to transport personnel and goods, while disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans attempted to cross the Atlantic to transport personnel and supplies to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, with U-boats as its main force, attempted to intercept this transport.
If the Allied Powers had failed at that time, Germany would have likely conquered England just like it did with other European countries.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
Family goats are usually herded in groups on mountains or other grazing areas. They are typically cared for by young goat herders (mostly children or teenagers), similar to more well-known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
Britain built freight roads as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn tram was made up of parallel wooden planks, at that time, compared to the slightly rough roads, these trams could make the horses pull faster and carry more.
Rail sleepers were introduced very early on to secure the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but the iron pieces will cause more serious wear and tear on the wooden carriage wheels.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was born.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, meaning upright man, humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the southern ancient apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
People discovered the phenomenon of bipedal specialization in the southern ape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus from Chad may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become active environmentalists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic therapy. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it thoroughly.
It is obvious that the world has undergone significant changes due to the progress of human science and technology, while overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans have made the problem more serious.
The handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th, and then sent to John Dunlap's printing press several blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, which is now known as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The remaining 25 copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest surviving versions of the document. The handwritten original manuscript was not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have been living until now, which we call "birds".
Many people believe they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only take one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, which are known as "bits" in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not immediately manifest, symptoms such as vomiting are very common, therefore a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indicator of ingesting poison may be containers that have been opened on the scene, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term originates from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin bugs and stink bugs are nest-dwelling insects that adapt to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their children.
These couples may create adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that another couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out the way the world operates through scientific methods. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are a way to test and eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but experiments are not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific fields (including psychology) have been accepted one by one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has moved away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Researchers have observed that many physiological and behavioral rhythms are largely dependent on endogenous cycles generated through the biological clock and their presence.
The periodic rhythm is not just a simple response to external periodic signals. This rhythm is recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to operate freely for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase is one of the main pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of bacteriophages, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of bacteriophages.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells will be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural scenery tourism industry attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas, they come to admire the natural landscapes including wildlife and plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from the small town to go to work, and the workplace of the people they pass by on the road is exactly where they are leaving.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is connected to and supports the private car-based transportation system in some way.
Now, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the biosphere that has supported human evolution and development for the past 2 million years.
Every person is a part of society and will use the transportation system. Almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of the same magnitude about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of traffic flow focuses on the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is very difficult because it is impossible to make a 100% accurate prediction of driver behavior.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow often exhibits a certain level of reasonable consistency, which can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings back along their bodies.
This gives them more small area space to avoid predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus once said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but there are also many people who hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and the sun (even other stars) as well.
This seems reasonable, because the Earth does not feel like it is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and also the largest. Its water volume is more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections reaching a width of 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total freshwater discharge into the world's oceans.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6387 kilometers (3980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and advanced construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors that had been standing for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations, and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most people working in the country on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can all be found in nature in their natural form, and are relatively easy to mine using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they will transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements belong to metals, while silver and gold are also metals.
Alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon) are also available.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them can fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, when the pencil was invented, it became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status of pencils is getting lower and their usage is decreasing.
People now write information on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only guess what the outcome of the keyboard will be when the updated product appears.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Split the atomic nucleus again, and then release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the crust is about 70 kilometers thick, while the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
The crust beneath the dark side is thinner, while the crust beneath the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the closer side may have more dark areas, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content motivation theory is to find factors that are relatable or interesting to people.
These theories suggest that when people mature to a certain extent and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
Why do some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. One scenario is that they will strive to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions, and they also face challenges in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
In another extreme situation, this person would become a completely different individual, feeling that he/she must change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the contact point for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible team" refers to a management team where each member reports to it. It sets standards for all members.
Why does an organization need to spend so much time building a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality will occur.
Therefore, an organization working together to overcome obstacles often brings about new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"The Angel" (2006) interprets the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical methods in cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and workings of the brain, which were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building a simulation model, which helps us understand the process of how the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan, and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, and some household computers and electronic game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important part of any teaching activity. Typically, teachers are happy to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can view artificial artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire exquisite artworks in the classroom.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a good way to review the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often have sloppy grammar and spelling when they start blogging, the presence of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so blog authors are starting to work hard to improve their writing skills and avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "forces students to have more insight into the surrounding world". Inspired to meet the interests of the audience, students become smarter and more interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Proper use of blogs can help students become more adept at analysis and critical thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their own position within the context of others' articles and be able to articulate their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charming and bilingual, with a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present as highlights.
To the south is Niagara Falls, while to the north is the undeveloped natural beauty of the Muskoka River and the opposite bank.
All these factors have made Ontario the typical image of Canada that foreigners envision.
Further north, the vast area has sparse population, and some places are desolate wilderness without any signs of human presence.
A surprising comparison of population data: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island so far, still a separate continent for wildlife.
Smaller islands are mostly independent countries or belong to France, known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine prevails in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The northern part borders the Sahel region; the southern and western parts are on the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors that they perceive as harassment; and incidents such as being followed or grabbed are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and do not be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, always firmly refuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids. The port was once known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt this city, naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in Morocco.
Near the old town of Medina, shops selling traditional Moroccan products such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs can be seen everywhere, but these shops are all targeting tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to conduct prior research before traveling to anywhere outside of Goma to find out if the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
"Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign land because of its relative remoteness.
Today, although Timbuktu's reputation has made it a tourist destination and it has an airport, it is still a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of the desert, it was listed on the World Heritage List in Danger.
This is an important stop for Henry Louis Gates in the special program "Wonders of the African World" on the American Public Broadcasting Corporation.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more Arabic in style rather than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, this park charges conservation fees and entrance fees every day.
Buying a Wild Card also has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some or all of the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with Hong Kong and is also the focal point for many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a sparkling bar graph, standing out especially against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is a place occupied by British colonizers, so if you want to find evidence of the colonial history of this territory, this is a very good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. This part of the forest within India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, there are also remnants of some huge jungles, which used to cover the entire Ganges Plain.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 square kilometers, with approximately one-third being water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses run all day from the urban intercity bus station (across the river), but most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to the frequent full capacity of the shuttle bus, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most areas can sit in comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
To go to nearby places such as Palo (Nu 150) and Punaka (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a fast and comfortable way.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting the Brazilian Oiapoque and the French Guiana's Saint-Georges.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the length of the bridge is 378 meters, and there are two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs inspection station is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern region of present-day Paraguay, they lead a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle and also engage in self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who rely on hunting, gathering, and fishing for their livelihood.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Indian Province," a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been striving to preserve many of the indigenous characteristics and features of the city of Asunción.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held at the polo field in Las Cañitas in December.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
You can exchange currency at the island's only bank, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.
In outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but British and American currency can be used; please contact the host in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange currency of the Falkland Islands outside the island, so exchange it before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, the temperature often exceeds 30°C.
Winter may feel colder than it looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
Park management staff said: Maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how gentle they may appear, almost all large animals such as bison, elk, moose, bears, etc. have the potential to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large in size, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that emits odors, and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle organized by the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Shore Beach (located within the North Shore area) is on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Here is the translation: "Here is almost all beaches, swimming is very safe, most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees."
Tamaki Drive Beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, lined with a variety of shops along the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is "Number One" beer. It has a simple taste, but very drinkable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Here you can buy a lot of French wine, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be more resistant to long-distance transportation.
The local tap water can fully meet safety drinking standards, but if you are still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is an "espresso", the cream in a cappuccino is piled high (not foam), and tea is not paired with milk.
The hot chocolate meets the Belgian standard. The juice is expensive, but of good quality.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are very few cases of injuries due to participating in any of the above activities at the Great Barrier Reef.
However, it is still necessary to follow the advice of the relevant departments, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish will appear on the beaches and river mouths near the town of 1770 from October to April each year. Occasionally, their presence can also be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is not the ocean, but the river mouths in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing there will be a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Although travel agencies may help you book camping and other forms of accommodation, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and some even provide flight and hotel accommodation packages.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable, or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be processed through the travel agent, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this to be a very important part of the music festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a good spot near the stage.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue playing music into the late night.
Some music festivals will set up special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as sailing on the ice can bring very scary noise to those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes sightseeing activities within the city. Cruise passengers are eligible for visa exemptions (please refer to the terms of service for details).
Casinos typically try to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. Casinos usually do not have windows or clocks, and exits are also hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and stay in the casino.
Some venues provide alcohol for free. However, getting drunk can weaken a person's judgment, and all excellent gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high latitude areas should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the icy road surface, the friction is small, you cannot drive like on a smooth asphalt road.
During a blizzard, the snowfall can quickly become heavy enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snowflakes, water droplets or ice on the car windows may also obstruct the view.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is rarely interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting activities may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa, and also the highlight of many tourists' itineraries.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to traveling by land to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially on tropical grasslands.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) often like to get close to cars, and standard equipment can allow people to better appreciate them.
Lions, leopards, and cheetahs are sometimes very afraid of people, you can see more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "jungle trekking", "hiking trip" or "trekking") mainly involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a tricky situation.

The stirrups hang on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but also pose a safety hazard as the rider's feet may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off the horse but one foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him while running. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots, and the soles are smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - are equipped with safety buckles, so if the rider falls off and pulls backwards, the stirrup leather will come off the saddle.

In general, it is not necessary to look for discounted business class or first class tickets when flying directly from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a high price to enjoy the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so airlines will accordingly charge fees.
