This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers - a theory that has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown at the top and light or carrot-colored at the bottom.
This discovery also helps to deepen our understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central shaft - known as the "rachis", but they do have other feather features such as barbs and barbules, leading researchers to infer that the evolution of the rachis may have occurred later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers indicates that they are not used for flying, but for regulating temperature or display. Researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
Researchers believe that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers rather than the down of a chick.

In France, traditionally voting is a low-tech experience: voters enter a small booth and place a pre-printed paper indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will place the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter register.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every step of the election process on site. In the evening, volunteers count the votes according to specific procedures under close supervision.

The Director of Public Prosecutions and Royal Legal Advisor Kier Starmer announced this morning that charges have been brought against Huna and Price.
Huhne has resigned and he will be replaced in the Cabinet by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take the Business Minister job Davey is vacating.
Huna and Price will appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback. Cuddeback was driving at the time.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and chin, while Kristoffer Schneider will need facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon malfunctioned when pointing at the fifth person. Schneider was in excruciating pain, with one eye blinded, a piece of skull missing, and his face reconstructed using titanium plates.
Schneider testified via video link at a US Air Force (USAF) base in his home country.
In addition to Wednesday's match, Carpanedo also participated in two individual competitions in the championship.
Her first event was obstacle skiing, and she finished the race with an "unfinished" result in the first round. 36 out of the 116 participants achieved the same result in the competition.
Her other event is the giant slalom, where she finished tenth in the women's standing group with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first-placed Austrian athlete Claudia Roth and 1:09.02 minutes behind the ninth-placed Hungarian athlete Gyonki Dani.
In the women's sitting group, four skiers did not finish the race, and 45 out of 117 participants in the Giant Slalom event did not make it onto the leaderboard.
The Central State Police recovered the stolen laptop and cellphone.
Deputy Commissioner of Police D K Arya said, "We have arrested 5 people for raping the Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendants' names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though the car crashed into the house with three people inside, no one was injured in the end.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, and emergency rescue personnel rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth for treatment.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Afterwards, Adekya was charged with the murder of her son and stood trial at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was detained, awaiting prosecution and trial; however, any witness evidence may be negatively influenced as her image has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, with the courts believing that publishing photos could potentially cause harm.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee pointed out, "It seems indeed harmful for journalists to disclose the suspect's photos and other information."
The main department responsible for prosecution, the Royal Prosecution Service, has told reporters that they will not make any further comments at least until charges are filed.
According to reports, the document will mention border disputes, with Palestine hoping to base them on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other topics of discussion include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands to deploy military forces in the central valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinian National Authority only agrees to retain them for five years.
Foresters will closely monitor shooters participating in pest control supplementary trials, as the trials will be monitored and their effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales Shooting Association (NSW), the shooting association recruited qualified volunteers for the hunting program.
Mick O'flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Management at the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), stated that the four shooters selected to participate in the first shooting operation have all received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in as a member of the new temporary Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of 9 members.
This is Martelly's fifth time being selected to the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) in Haiti in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the former CEP to resign, as part of the push towards new election measures in the country.
The committee is Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
Since 2011, these protest activities have been triggered by some elections that have failed to take place as scheduled, and sometimes the protests escalate into violent events.
According to reports, there have been approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunctions and overheating, resulting in 6 fires and 4 minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan has noted 27 incidents related to the equipment.
Last week, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating incidents to the department, although the company stated that these incidents were "not serious".
The Ministry of Economic Affairs responded that the delay in releasing the report by Apple is "very regrettable".
The Mariana Islands experienced an earthquake at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported that there were no disaster losses domestically.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that no tsunami signs were detected.
A former police officer in the Philippines hijacked a tourist bus in the capital Manila, taking Hong Kong tourists on board as hostages.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Multiple hostages have been rescued, with at least six hostages confirmed dead at present.
Six hostages (including children and elderly individuals) as well as those Filipino photographers were released ahead of schedule.
The two photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendosa was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career as a doctor.
He received training as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
When Liggins worked at the hospital, he began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research indicates that the application of hormones can accelerate the maturation of a baby's fetal lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators found two "black box" flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also mourned Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first lady of extreme, my first manager. Luna passed away on a night of the double moons. Such nights were as special as she was. She was a strong woman."
Dustin Runnels, also known as "Goldust," commented, "Luna was as elusive as I am... she may have been even more elusive... I love her, and I will miss her... I hope she has gone to a better place."
Before the 2010 federal election, a survey was conducted on 1,400 respondents, showing that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II abdicates.
34% of respondents unanimously expressed their wish for Queen Elizabeth II to become the last monarch of Australia.
There is a polarization in voting, with 29% of respondents believing that Australia should establish a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his health has been questioned due to his complaints.
He has been unable to use medication to relieve the pain because the competition prohibits participants from taking these drugs.
Mathematician and computer science professor Curtis Cooper from the University of Central Missouri discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
In early February, several individuals verified this discovery using different hardware and software, and announced it on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water and organic materials on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain the existence of life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets have formed since the collision between comets and Earth a long time ago, especially the formation of Earth.
Cuomo, 53, has been serving as governor since the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as "political gossip and foolish behavior".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) states that the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) can shorten flight routes for aircraft, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, allowing air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
Without additional transportation options, the overground train at Wembley does not stop, and there are no parking lots or transfer facilities on the ground.
Due to concerns about a lack of transportation, the game may be forced to be played behind closed doors without the support of any fans.
On Thursday, a study published in the journal "Science" reported that a new species of bird has emerged in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that a new species evolved in just two generations due to breeding between the native Darwin's finches and the introduced cactus finches, despite the belief that this process would take longer.
Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be curled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a fine thread for wrapping and weaving. It can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, stuck onto other metals, and because it is so thin, it is sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage juice will change depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
The pH value is represented by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Stir the two dry powders together to mix them, then knead them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, forming a shell-like substance, which feels very interesting.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had almost every household equipped with flush toilets that were connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Remains of sewage systems were found in houses in the cities of Knossos on the island of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were part of mixed-gender public baths.
When you make a phone call to someone far away, you will use a satellite.
After receiving the call in space, the satellite almost immediately reflected it back.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere can distort certain light and views.
To send a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. Its greatest contribution to us is making our transportation more convenient.
With it, we have trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized felines, which prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits and antelopes to deer.
In the end, many small felids (including free-roaming pet cats) prey on a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, with each cat being responsible for a specific task, preventing them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of all the cat species, living in large groups called prides.
The lion pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
As sisters and daughters in a big family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of a pride of lions is very similar to that of a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals exhibit remarkably similar behaviors to lions (but unlike other large feline species), and these behaviors are also very deadly for their prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes, capable of climbing (although not very strong climbers), swimming, jumping far, and having a pulling force five times that of a human strongman.
Tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars belong to the same genus (Panthera). These four big cats are the only ones in the Felidae family that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not as deep as the roar of a lion, but more like an angry growling speech.
The leopard cat likes to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. The prey of the leopard cat is almost always much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that the ocelot tracks and hunts prey on the ground by following the scent and traces of the animals they want to prey on.
Their night vision is strong, allowing them to see clearly in the dark, and their movements are very stealthy. The fishing method of the leopard cat is to blend into the surrounding environment first, and then pounce on the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (such as crossing mountains and rivers, or reaching a new island where it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptability to become a strong competitor, rather than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time passes, new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, becoming increasingly dissimilar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will eventually look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which is the formation of new species. Speciation is a necessary outcome of evolution and a crucial part of the evolutionary process.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses, to make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Canglong was the top predator of that era, fearing nothing except its own kind.
Its lower jaw is lined with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, with a row on the upper jaw as well. This means that anything that encounters it has no way to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, which we are not sure about. Its diet includes sea turtles, large fish, other sea dragons, and it may even eat humans.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex are no match for it.
Although most of the Roman diet consisted of foods that are familiar to us, they did have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on chairs to eat, while the rich prefer to gather together for banquets and eat while reclining.
Centuries later, food that was introduced to Europe from the Americas or Asia could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever ate turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, considering it as the residence of that god.
People will offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests will satisfy the needs of the gods through rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard for public access, as well as an inner sanctum that only priests can enter.
Some special towers are in the shape of a pyramid, known as pyramid-shaped pagodas, which are built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special sacred place of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not as important.
The life of Hebrew families is mostly spent outdoors.
The women are cooking in the yard; the shops are actually open counters facing the street. They use stones to build houses.
Canyon does not have large forests, so wood is very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Norse saga of the Saga, the red-bearded Eric was exiled from Iceland for murder, sailed west, discovered land, and named it Greenland.
But whether he realized it or not, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although all belonging to "Scandinavia," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that there is a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case. Although there is something written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence is inscribed with the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776." The text is written at the bottom of the document and is upside down.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) is said to have been rolled up for storage when it was first written.
Therefore, it is very likely that this symbol was added just as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French. These French people reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not resisting the invaders, but cooperating with them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France in an operation known as "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the armies of the United States and Free France liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a population (society) living together and working cooperatively.
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "of a citizen"), which is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizen") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "state"), thus defining the scale of society in some way.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture means the passing down of knowledge through generations, the lingering presence of cultural footprints, and the fair dissemination of culture.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving behind relevant historical evidence and are not considered as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation (with Congress as its only component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no national executive or judicial branch, Congress can only rely on state governments to enforce all laws, which state governments often do not cooperate with.
It also does not have the power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These provisions must be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, but the states' attitude towards the central government is so disdainful that their state representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are the second most successful teams in the world, both winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to Japan's numerous islands, it is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geological perspective.
Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. At that time, European sailors passing by named the island "Ilha Formosa," which means beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, changing the indigenous people's food production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) army took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Qing Empire declared Taiwan a province.
In 1895, after losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
In order to allow visitors to better understand the original appearance of the architectural complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the era of film.
'To this day, production still exists, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.'
The actual dimensions of the 35mm format are 36mm wide and 24mm high, making this format a bit confusing.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by 12 to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats, such as the APS format series, have the same or a similar aspect ratio.
The often abused and ridiculed rule of thirds can be a simple guiding method in creating dynamics and keeping images organized.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the already wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was closely monitored.
Despite the differences in languages and customs among European countries, Christianity has connected them for over a thousand years.
From kings to commoners, the power of it spreads across the ten directions, influencing everyone.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically set up for this purpose.
The centralized system of power in the Roman Catholic Church existed for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they are adhering to this creed.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, Britain began to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
They cut off vital military and civilian supplies. The strategy has proven effective, even though such a blockade violates established international law that has been widely accepted for the past two centuries based on several international agreements.
Britain is laying mines in international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire area, even posing a threat to neutral vessels.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany hopes that its unrestricted submarine warfare will also receive a similar response.
In the 1920s, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the brutality and devastation of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and took a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he had 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, addressed to Thomas Edison.
In different periods of ancient China, each period or each family ruling the country had its own characteristics; each dynasty in China had its own distinct features.
Similarly, during the changes of dynasties throughout history, there were periods of instability and division among small countries. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years and was situated between the transitions of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these turbulent times, various warlords waged fierce wars to compete for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died in the struggle for the highest power in the luxurious palaces of Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications as well, such as the use of measurement units, the transition from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
After the revolution, official positions were open for application to all men, giving ambitious and successful individuals the opportunity to rise to the top.
The military is the same, as ranks are no longer based on hierarchy, but on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in different countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond worldly life. He used to meditate in a cave called "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (Light).
The cave itself not only withstands the test of time and remains intact, but also brings extremely vivid imagery to Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on a mountaintop in the northern part of Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even if you know of its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, you are completely cut off from the outside world.
Apart from the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, nothing else can be seen. Inside the cave, almost nothing can be seen or heard from the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only structure among the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the ancient Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of the many large pyramids built to pay tribute to the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, also known as the "Giza Pyramid Complex," includes multiple pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "up bow" symbol looks like the letter V, while the "down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square missing its bottom edge.
"Up" refers to pushing the bow starting from the top, while "down" refers to pulling the bow starting from the handle (where the hand holds the bow).
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow produces a stronger and more resolute sound.
Feel free to make your own marks with a pencil, but remember that the printed notes have musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis Charles), and the king's sister Madame Elizabeth were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a group of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, where a group of people surrounded them, shouting threats at the king and queen.
'The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.'
In front of the terrified queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at the Palace of Versailles.
During the war of conquest in the Philippines, the war expenses of American imperialism were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most expenses, as well as the interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the high profits obtained from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people have become the primary benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the background that led to the establishment of the Knights Templar.
The era in which the event occurred is commonly referred to as the heyday of European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Before the peak of the Middle Ages was the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, conventionally considered to have ended around 1500.
The technological determinism is a term that encompasses many ideas in practice, including technological determinism, technological necessity, and a strict definition - the fate of humanity is driven by the underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most explanations of technological determinism include these two overarching ideas: first, that the development of technology itself largely transcends cultural or political influences, and second, that technology in turn exerts an inherent "impact" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, some may argue that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, it is not economically feasible to have only a few cars covering the entire national road network, so a new production method has emerged to reduce the cost of car ownership.
A higher number of cars in circulation will lead to a higher rate of road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for treating injuries.
Romanticism has a strong cultural determinism, stemming from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to geography emerge. These customs and cultures, harmoniously integrated with the society's location, are much better than any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center for luxury goods began around the year 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD.
Its position declined in the 12th century mainly because the gifts brought back by the Crusaders, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak from the 10th to the 14th century.
Initially, skirts were heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the biggest advancements at the time was the use of buttons to fasten clothing after the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agricultural activity carried out to produce food only sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a simple and often organic system that maximizes yield by using local seeds preserved within the ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in subsistence agricultural production. This is still the case in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together, who feel overlooked by societal norms, fostering a sense of identity among them.
Given the age, race, class, location, and/or gender differences among members, subcultures may have their own unique characteristics.
The distinctive traits that make subcultures unique may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or multiple factors.
Members of subcultural groups often symbolically use unique styles of behavior, including fashion, demeanor, and slang, to express their membership identity.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the cases of a few unfortunate children. These children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, did not achieve socialization in their upbringing without the help of adults.
Children like this are called "wild children," meaning feral children. Some wild children are confined by people, usually their own parents; in some cases, children are abandoned because parents refuse to accept severe intellectual or physical disabilities in their child.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
It is said that some people were raised by animals; others live alone in the wild.
If a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limits of physical capability) will be very similar to that of the animals, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolded learning goes even further.
'Scaffolded instruction is not a learning method, but a means of assisting individuals who are just learning to use new computer programs or start new projects.'
Bracket teaching can be conducted online or offline, in other words, teachers are a form of bracket teaching, just like the paperclip assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support is internalized in the software to question, prompt, and explain procedures that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment without manners, care, and education, but unfortunately, this is often the case.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide everything that the original family lacks.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet add extra dimensions in terms of its uses and modes of satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
When studying audience reactions to websites, Aime and McKee (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "sustained relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video recordings has brought significant discoveries in explaining microexpressions (facial movements lasting a few milliseconds).
Specifically, it is said that one can determine if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who cannot understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior may be a common skill among animals such as pet dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two types of gene mutations: dominant and recessive.
Mutation adds new genetic variations, while selection removes mutations from the pool of expressed genetic variations.
Due to segregation and recombination, variations fluctuate between the two populations in each generation.
In tropical grasslands, primates have a digestive system similar to humans, and the existing plant resources are insufficient to meet their amino acid needs.
In addition, failure to do so will have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant-based resources are likely to be protein from leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, it is difficult to digest this protein unless it is cooked.
In contrast, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In conclusion, if our ancestors' approach to solving the "protein problem" is no different from the methods used by chimpanzees in tropical grasslands today, we should not be surprised.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that allows you to wake up without being fully disturbed.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place the alarm clock on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythmic based choices include drinking a large amount of fluids before bed (especially water or tea - known to have diuretic effects) and forcing oneself to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace in a person is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The smaller the pressure, the more actively vitality is displayed. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone has the potential to reach enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own sense of tension and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it is expanded through the universal love of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
'In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and universal love.'
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, chanting, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Sky Yoga. By visualizing different deities, purifying energy channels, and activating chakras, one can achieve the state of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy of the various countries during World War II, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, with the end of the war, conflicts in terms of systems, procedures, and culture led to the two countries going their separate ways.
Two years after the war ended, former allies have now become enemies, and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for 40 years, with proxy armies fighting real battles from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been breached, and the only remaining hope was to retreat and reorganize the army along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost abandoned overnight, as over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and began fortifying positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
So far, shipping has been the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
In traditional terms, the mission of the navy is to ensure the country's ability to transport personnel and goods, while also disrupting the enemy's ability to transport their personnel and goods.
A notable modern example is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II, where Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, mainly consisting of U-boats, attempted to intercept the transport.
If the Allies had failed at that time, Germany would have likely conquered England just as it had conquered other countries in Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consuming and using their milk, meat, fur, and skin.
Mountain goats are typically herded in groups on mountains or other grazing areas, usually tended to by young goat herders (mostly children or teenagers) who are similar to more widely known shepherds. These herding methods are still in use today.
In the 16th century, Britain had already built cart roads.
Although the horse-drawn tram was only made of parallel wooden planks, at that time, these cars could make the horses run faster and pull more on the slightly rough roads.
Railroad ties were introduced very early on to secure the rails. However, people gradually realized that placing iron plates on the rails would make them more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but the iron strips will cause more severe wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
In the end, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was born.
The first known mode of transportation is walking. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus, meaning upright man, humans began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the southern apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
People discovered the phenomenon of bipedal specialization in the southern ape fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus from Chad may have been walking on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future disasters.
In many cases, this is very similar to symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and completely eradicate it.
It is obvious that significant changes have occurred in the world due to advancements in human science and technology, with overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans making the issues more serious.
The handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4th and then sent to John Dunlap's printing press several blocks away for printing.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, known today as the "Dunlap broadsides" edition.
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving copies of the Dunlap broadsides are the earliest known versions of the document. The handwritten original manuscript did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have been living until now, which we call "birds".
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still have many similarities with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Today, almost all computers in use are based on processing information encoded in binary.
Binary numbers can only take on one of two values, either 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary digits, or "bits" in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not immediately manifest, symptoms such as vomiting are common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The most powerful indicator of ingesting poison may be containers that have been opened on the scene, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the label on the poison for specific first aid instructions.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to formally refer to this type of insect.
This term comes from people's familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nest-dwelling insects, adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In various regions of the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the primary neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis (MS).
A couple may decide not to have children for their own benefit or for the benefit of their offspring.
These couples may create adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their rights as parents so that another couple could raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to discover how the world operates through the scientific method. In fact, this method can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experimentation is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but it is not the only method. Asking questions and making observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific fields, including psychology, were all accepted one by one.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West moved away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Researchers have observed that many physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms are largely dependent on endogenous cycles generated through the biological clock and its presence.
The periodic rhythm is not just a simple response to external periodic signals. This rhythm is documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillating device that can continue to operate freely for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase is one of the key pieces of evidence demonstrating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one using radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophage, and the other using radioactive sulfur to label the protein of the bacteriophage.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells will be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
The natural landscape tourism industry attracts tourists who are interested in natural areas, they come to admire the natural scenery including wildlife and plants.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to go to work, passing by the workplaces of those they encounter on the road, which happen to be where they are leaving from.
In this dynamic traffic shuttle, everyone is connected in some way to the car-based transportation system and supports it.
Today, science shows that this large-scale carbon economy can no longer maintain the stability of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past 2 million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everyone has complaints about the transportation system.
'In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of the same magnitude about water quality or bridge collapses.'
Why does the transportation system generate such complaints? Why do they break down every day? Is it because the transportation engineers are incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
The study of traffic flow focuses on the movement of drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because it is impossible to predict drivers' behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flow often exhibits a certain level of reasonable consistency that can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships are helpful for the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to evade enemies and more effectively search for food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in being able to fold their wings back along their bodies.
This allows them to have more small areas to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believe he is right, but there are also many who hold the opposite view; they believe that the solar system revolves around the Earth, and that the sun (and even other stars) do too.
This seems reasonable, as the Earth does not feel like it is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with some stretches reaching widths of up to 6 miles.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total freshwater discharge into the world's oceans.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The river water comes from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the grand scale and superior construction techniques of the Giza pyramids have never been surpassed.
During the New Kingdom period, the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which had been standing for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws, regulations, and official communications.
Italian is also the language used by most people working in the country on a daily basis, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these elements can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract using primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in no particular order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also proposed a theory that they would transform into new substances, forming the things we see.
'Alloys are basically made up of two or more metals mixed together. Don't forget, there are many elements on the periodic table.'
Calcium, potassium, and other elements belong to metals, and elements like silver and gold are also metals, of course.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
In the universe, everything is made up of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that the period at the end of this sentence could contain trillions of atoms.
Therefore, when the pencil was introduced, it became a favorite of many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and usage of pencils are decreasing.
People now write messages on computer screens and never have to touch a pencil sharpener again.
People can only guess what the outcome will be for the keyboard when the updated product is released.
The working principle of a fission atomic bomb is as follows: it requires energy to bring together a nucleus and many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy cart up a hill. Split the atomic nucleus again, and then release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable atomic nuclei, which means they are likely to undergo fission with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The near side of the crust is about 70 kilometers thick, while the far side is about 100 kilometers thick.
The crust beneath the dark side is thinner, while the crust beneath the highlands is thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the near side may have more dark areas, and lava is more likely to rise to the surface.
The core of the content motivation theory is to find factors that are relatable or interesting to individuals.
These theories suggest that as people mature and enter adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
Why some people want to do what they do, and what in their environment will make them do or not do certain things, are the subjects of these theoretical studies.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start leading former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. One situation is that they will strive to maintain a "close relationship" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions and also face challenges in implementing disciplinary measures, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
'In another extreme scenario, this individual would transform into a completely different person, feeling the need to change everything the team has done and take credit for the results.'
After all, leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for their corresponding offline teams.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their team may schedule meetings for different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"The Invisible Team" refers to a management team where each member reports to it. It sets standards for all members.
Why would an organization spend so much time building a learning organization? One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional departments of an organization, creativity and originality will occur.
Therefore, in the process of collectively overcoming obstacles, an organization often brings about new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and engage in organized learning.
"Angels" (2006) interprets the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches in cognitive research. Therefore, it narrows down the scope of research and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can provide support for scientists' research.
We have long known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors can affect a person's behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and functioning of the brain, which were previously unseen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models, helping us understand the process of brain operation.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction element, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science that studies the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan, and schedule, respond to customer diagnoses and issues, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial features.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, with some household computers and electronic gaming software applications already incorporating built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field trips are an important component of any teaching activity. Typically, teachers are more than willing to take students to places that buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are a high-tech solution. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire exquisite artworks in the classroom.
Sharing virtual field trips is also a great way to review the trip and share experiences with the class later on.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned annually, but old versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students may start blogging with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of readers often changes this situation.
Students are often the most critical readers, so blog authors are starting to work hard to improve their writing skills and avoid criticism.
In addition, writing blogs also "forces students to have more insight into the world around them." Inspired by the audience's interests, students become smarter and more interesting.
Writing a blog is a tool that can inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional classroom teaching.
"Proper use of blogs can help students become more adept at analysis and critical thinking; by actively engaging with online materials, students can situate themselves within the context of others' writings and articulate their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
'Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charming and bilingual, with highlights including a series of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.'
Heading further south is Niagara Falls, while to the north is Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty across the river.
All of these factors make Ontario the typical image of Canada that foreigners have in mind.
Further north in the vast area, the population is sparse, and some places are desolate wilderness with no signs of human habitation.
A surprising comparison of population data: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest island and remains a separate continent for wildlife.
Most smaller islands are independent countries or territories of France, known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, and this doctrine prevails in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The north borders the Sahel region; the south and west are on the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female tourists, regardless of their actual marital status, should say that they are married.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (but avoid wearing rings that look too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead to behaviors that they perceive as harassment, and incidents such as being followed or grabbed are not uncommon.
When rejecting a man, be firm and do not be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, be resolute in your refusal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, the port was once known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt the city, naming it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading post here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping destinations in all of Morocco.
Near the old town of Marrakech, shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine pots, pottery, leather goods, and hookahs can be found everywhere, but these shops are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located on the easternmost side of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano. The lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is advisable to conduct research before traveling anywhere outside of Goma to determine if the ongoing conflict in North Kivu Province has eased.
This city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla tracking project.
You can take a boda-boda (rented motorcycle) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for a short trip is 500 Congolese francs.
Due to its relative remoteness, "Timbuktu" is used as a metaphor for a distant foreign land.
Today, despite Timbuktu's reputation as a tourist destination and having an airport, it remains a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of the desert, it was listed on the endangered World Heritage list.
This is a key stop in Henry Louis Gates' special program "Wonders of the African World" on PBS.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more of an Arab style rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, providing support for various wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship attraction of the South African National Parks system (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges conservation fees and entrance fees daily.
Buying a Wild Card also has many benefits. With this card, you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is synonymous with the Hong Kong region and is also the focal point for many tourists.
The numerous buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are like a sparkling bar graph, especially striking against the backdrop of Victoria Harbour.
If you want to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hong Kong from the best angle, you can leave the island and head to the waterfront of Kowloon across the harbor.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the northern shore.
This is the place where British colonizers occupied, so if you are looking for evidence of colonial history in this territory, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, stretching 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the coast inland to Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This portion of the forest within India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just mangrove swamps, they also contain remnants of some huge jungle, which once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary. It is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses run all day from the intercity bus station (across the river), but most services, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Due to the frequent full capacity of the shuttle bus, it is recommended to purchase tickets several days in advance.
Most regions can ride in comfortable and sturdy Japanese Coaster minibuses.
To go to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oyapock River, connecting Brazil's Oiapoque and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The project was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, at which time the Brazilian customs inspection station is also expected to be completed.
The Guaraní people are the most important indigenous group living in the eastern region of Paraguay, where they lead a semi-nomadic hunting lifestyle and engage in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is the homeland of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who rely on hunting, gathering, and fishing for their livelihood.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Indian Province" and was the result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century-long colonial period.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción, Paraguay has managed to preserve many of the indigenous characteristics and features of the city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top polo teams and players.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here.
To learn about tournament news and how to purchase polo match tickets, please visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound, which is equivalent to the British pound.
'Currency can be exchanged at the island's only bank, located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.'
The pound is generally accepted everywhere on the island, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted within Stanley.
On outlying islands, credit cards may not be accepted, but English and American currency can be used; please contact the host in advance to confirm acceptable payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the island, so it should be exchanged before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter may feel colder than it actually looks: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but when the wind and humidity combine, it can feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no specific "rainy season" and "dry season" here: the annual rainfall is roughly the same.
Although many animals in the park are used to humans, wild animals are still wild animals, and we should not feed or disturb them.
The park management stated that visitors should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals have the potential to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured because they fail to maintain a proper distance. These animals are large in size, wild, and have potential dangers, so please give them some space.
In addition, be aware that odors can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food that emits odors, and keep the campsite clean.
'Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.'
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a notorious naval standoff occurred in the bay, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the bay.
Except for one British cruiser, all other ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle organized by the Mau movement for independence, a peaceful rally in the town led to the assassination of the high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Oakland spans two harbors, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beach on the north shore (located in the North Shore District) stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south on the Pacific Ocean.
Here is almost all beach, swimming is very safe, and most places have shade from New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive beach is located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with vacationing families, and there are various shops along the coast. Swimming is very safe.
The main local beer is called "Number One" beer. It has a simple taste, but is very enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Here you can find many French wines, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be more resilient to long-distance transportation.
The local tap water meets safety drinking standards, but if you are still concerned, bottled water is easily available.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is still relatively unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino has a high pile of cream (not foam), and tea is not served with milk.
The hot chocolate meets the standards of Belgium. The juice is expensive, but of good quality.
Many people visit the Great Barrier Reef throughout the year, and there are very few incidents of injuries due to participating in any of the activities mentioned above at the Great Barrier Reef.
However, it is still important to follow the advice of the relevant authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish can be found on the beaches and river mouths near the town of 1770 from October to April each year. Occasionally, they can also be spotted at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The primary habitat of saltwater crocodiles is not the ocean, but the river mouths in the northern part of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance can give travelers peace of mind, knowing that there will be a place to stay upon arrival at the destination.
While travel agencies may help you book camping or other forms of accommodation, they typically work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, and some even provide packages that include flights and hotel accommodations.
If you need time to consider whether the price is suitable or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to travel to the destination, they can hold the reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are needed, they should first be handled through the travel agent, rather than directly contacting the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and most participants consider this to be a crucial part of the festival experience.
If you want to watch the performance up close, you need to arrive early and secure a good spot near the stage.
Remember, while the music on the main stage may have ended, other parts of the festival may continue playing music late into the night.
Some music festivals will have special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as sailing on the ice can bring very frightening noise to those most affected.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes city sightseeing activities. Cruise passengers may be exempt from visas (please refer to the terms of service for details).
Casinos typically go to great lengths to make guests spend as much time and money as possible. They usually do not have windows or clocks, and exits are also hard to find.
They usually provide special food, drinks, and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and stay in the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, being drunk can weaken a person's judgment, and all successful gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving or crossing mountain passes in high latitude areas should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, so you cannot drive like you would on smooth asphalt roads.
'In a blizzard, the snowfall in a very short period of time can be enough to trap you.'
Snowfall, snowflakes, water droplets, or ice on the car windows may also obstruct the view.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is very common in many countries, and transportation is almost never interrupted throughout the year.
Hunting safaris may be the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight of many tourists' itineraries.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to traveling by land to observe the stunning African wildlife, especially on tropical grasslands.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often like to get close to vehicles, and standard equipment can allow people to appreciate them better.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards can sometimes be afraid of humans, and you can see them more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as "jungle trekking", "trekking", or "hiking") mainly involves walking on foot, usually taking several hours or lasting for several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other parts of Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may face a tricky situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the new coronavirus have not been extended to July 2020 - the original scheduled time for the Olympics.

Ironing damp clothes can help them dry out. Even if the room doesn't have an iron and ironing board, many hotels offer rental services.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer (if available).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this may cause shrinkage, and in extreme cases, burn the clothes).
There are many methods for purifying water, some of which are more effective for specific types of pollution.
'In some regions, one minute of boiling is enough, while in other regions, it may take several minutes.'
The effects of filters vary, so if you are concerned about this, you should consider purchasing bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not commonly seen in their hometown.
Pests can damage food, cause irritant reactions, and in more severe cases, can trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm humans through violence, are usually not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the opportunity to purchase tax-free goods at specific locations.
Travelers heading to countries/regions with heavy taxes on alcohol and tobacco products can sometimes save a lot of money by purchasing these items there.
The most challenging section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is the stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently passes through remote and isolated areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, you need to stay alert: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns everywhere.
The posted speed limits in that area are noticeably lower than before and after the section, with common speed limits being 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and the importance of strictly adhering to the speed limit requirements is also greater than in other sections.
However, what is strange is that the cell phone service here is much better than many other routes along the way, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very good, and the desserts in Bavaria are even more diverse, similar to their southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit desserts are very common, apples can be used for desserts all year round, and cherries and plums can be enjoyed in the summer.
Many German baked goods also feature almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often paired with strong coffee.
If you're looking for a flavorful snack, you can try jam-filled pastries, which are known by different names in different regions, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry rice is a dish primarily made with herbs and spices, served with meat or vegetables.
Curry rice dishes can be either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of water used.
In northern India and the inland regions of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just a general term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines across the country.
But if no further modifiers are added, the word often refers to food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now, all over the archipelago, Javanese cuisine can be found, including dishes with simple seasoning methods, and the main seasonings that Javanese people like are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various spices.
The stirrups hang on either side of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but also pose a safety risk as the rider's feet may get stuck.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but their foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag them while running. To minimize this risk, some preventive measures can be taken.
First, most horse riders wear heeled riding boots, with smooth and fairly narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles - especially English saddles - are equipped with safety buckles, so if the rider falls off and pulls backwards, the stirrup leather will come off the saddle.
Chile's premier climbing destination, Cochamó Valley, is known as the "Yosemite of South America," featuring a variety of granite cliffs and cliffs.
Looking out from the peak, there are breathtaking views. Climbers from around the world are constantly pioneering new routes on the continuous cliffs that can be used as climbing walls.
Skiing, including both regular skiing and snowboarding, is a very popular sport in which skis or a snowboard are attached to your feet as you slide down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is the main tourist activity for many skiing enthusiasts, who are sometimes referred to as "skiing fanatics," planning to ski at a specific location for the entire holiday.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first leisure skiing club in Australia.
Skiing freestyle: This activity is also known as cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski trekking.
This activity is related to alpine skiing trips or mountaineering, but usually does not involve either of these activities. These two activities are done on steep terrain and require stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski route as a similar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can travel farther than on foot - but only in very rare cases can you achieve the same speed as cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on a smooth track.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. In most cases, traveling through multiple countries means having to go through visa applications and passport checks multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen Area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to go through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately to each Schengen member country, saving time, money, and procedures.
There is no unified definition for what items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition varies by region, with the age limit in places like North America possibly being shorter than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although they are much younger in age compared to mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people. The cultural aspects surrounding this industry are also significant for many who make a living in other professions.
However, even from a traditional perspective, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry. They make a living through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and often use reindeer as pack animals.
Nowadays, many Sami people are involved in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income for the Sápmi, which is the Sami region.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Roma people, it is generally considered offensive as it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are planning to visit is under a travel warning, your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also seek advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is tailored for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advisories can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
The advice provided here is often more general, vague, and overly simplistic compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; this type of weather can cause destruction, severe social disorder, or casualties.
Adverse weather can occur anywhere in the world. Adverse weather comes in various types, depending on geographical location, terrain, and atmospheric conditions.

Anyone planning to travel to countries that may be considered war zones should undergo professional training.
Searching for "courses on dealing with hostile environments" on the internet may lead you to the address of local companies offering training.
This course typically covers all the issues discussed here, often delving into them with hands-on experience.
The training course typically lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes even weapons training.
Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications about survival in war zones are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must carry valid documents on their return journey.
As for whether they are willing to issue passports without specifying gender (X), or willing to change documents to match the desired name and gender, the willingness of governments varies.
The recognition of these documents by foreign governments varies greatly.
In the post-September 11 era, security checkpoint searches have become more intrusive.
Transgender individuals who have not undergone surgery have to reveal their privacy when going through a scanner, and cannot guarantee their own dignity.
Offshore currents are the rapid backflow of waves from the beach into the sea, typically occurring around reefs or similar areas.
The underwater terrain causes the backflow to concentrate in several deeper areas, where strong currents may form flowing towards deeper waters.
Most deaths are caused by swimming against the current and physical exhaustion, it is unlikely to succeed in swimming against the water flow.
After getting out of the swift water flow, swimming back is not as difficult.
Strive to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been found).
The impact of returning home is faster (honeymoon period is shorter), lasts longer, and may be more severe than cultural shock.
For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it can sometimes be difficult to readjust to their native culture.
After living abroad for a period of time and returning home, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and have shed some of the habits of your hometown culture.
When you first go abroad, people may be very patient and understanding with you because they know that travelers need time to adapt to a new country.
People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.

On the backdrop is the Sphinx, which is also the narrator of the epic tale.
The scene is displayed on the pyramids, with different pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several countries claim sovereignty over the islands, which have the most bases, with sixteen bases in operation on the island in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where the settlement of "Villa Las Estrellas" is located.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island. There, an active volcano crater is still submerged by floods, providing a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is located in the southern part of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountain ranges on the peninsula merge into the plateau here, then reform into the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, or the Sentinel Range, is home to Antarctica's highest mountain range, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile signals do not reach, satellite phones may be your only option.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made in outdoor areas with clear satellite signals.
This service is often used in shipping, including yachts and expeditions with remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about connecting to this service.
For those planning how to spend a gap year, study abroad has become an increasingly popular choice.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, as they can take a gap year before going to college without affecting their education.
In many cases, participating in a gapped year program abroad can significantly enhance your chances of furthering your education upon returning to your home country.
'In general, participating in these educational programs requires payment of tuition fees.'
Finland is an excellent destination for sailing, known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes", with thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelago.
In archipelagos and lakes, yachts are not necessary.
The size of the coastal islands and the largest lakes is sufficient to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats or even kayaks can provide a different experience.
Rowing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven to eight people.
Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand also have similar situations, but are unique in other aspects (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one to forty).
Most typical Baltic Sea cruises will have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that there will be several full days to explore this historic city and then return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only disembark for sightseeing while on a boat tour, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships highlight Berlin in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and the cruise price does not include the cost of touring this city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience, especially for those who have never flown before or have had painful experiences in the past.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the fears and aversions many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding the workings of an airplane and the procedures of flight may be helpful in overcoming fear caused by unknown or uncontrollable situations.
Express delivery companies can earn high rewards for delivering goods quickly. Often, time is crucial for business documents, goods, or parts for urgent repairs.
On certain routes, major companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it becomes a problem.
If they transport goods by air, it may take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The quickest way is to have it transported as checked baggage. According to airline regulations, it is prohibited to carry luggage for passengers who have not boarded, and you will need to be present at that time.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a large amount of money to enjoy this privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for your ticket).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the price of a business class ticket may be four times that of an economy class ticket, and the price of a first class ticket may be a staggering 11 times higher!
In general, when flying directly from A to B, there is no need to look for discounted business class or first class tickets.
The airlines are well aware that some core passengers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, so airlines will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-proclaimed establishment of the Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova. The republic has its own government and currency, but has not been recognized by any member of the United Nations.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic ties between the two regions of Moldova have been rebuilt.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox.

Please give this place the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about massacres or Nazis.
'Do not mark or graffiti on buildings to avoid damaging the site.'
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the locals prefer to speak Catalan, with the vast majority understanding the language. As for Spanish, almost everyone can understand it.
However, most signs only use Catalan because it is the first official language as required by law.

Nowadays, most of the former pre-modern observatories have been phased out and preserved only as museums or educational facilities.
As light pollution was not as severe during its heyday, observatories were typically built in urban areas or on campuses, making them more accessible than modern observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as "hanami," has been a tradition in Japan since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, and the plum blossom is a favorite flower among the Chinese people.
In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom parties were held by the Emperor for himself and other noble members of the royal family at the Imperial Palace.

In general, Singapore is a very safe place and navigation is also very easy. Once you arrive, you can buy almost anything.
But due to being in the "subtropics" several degrees north of the equator, you will need to deal with both high temperatures (year-round) and intense sunlight (which is relatively less common when the weather is clear).
Several buses also head north to Hebron, where the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.

Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, established to celebrate the birth of Christ.
Many traditions associated with this holiday are also embraced by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
One tradition is to stay awake outdoors on Easter Eve and watch the sunrise.
Of course, this tradition has its explanation in Christian theology, but it is likely a ritual celebrating spring and praying for a good harvest that existed before the birth of Christ.
Traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend, with congregants typically streaming into the celebration at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Initially, the animals reached these islands by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to their distance from the mainland, mammals are unable to make long journeys to the Galapagos Islands, making giant tortoises the main herbivores on the islands.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, they introduced many mammals, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, a period of time when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides an excellent opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be more or less dark all day long.
In these sparsely populated areas, light pollution is generally not a problem, and you can also enjoy the brilliant starry sky.
